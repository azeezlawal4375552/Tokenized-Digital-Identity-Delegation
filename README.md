# Tokenized Digital Identity Delegation (TDID)

A blockchain-powered framework that enables secure, granular, and revocable delegation of digital identity credentials through tokenized authorization mechanisms.

## Overview

The Tokenized Digital Identity Delegation (TDID) platform revolutionizes how individuals and organizations manage digital identity verification by creating a trustless ecosystem for delegating identity credentials. Built on blockchain technology, this framework allows identity owners to securely grant limited, time-bound permissions for others to act on their behalf without compromising their core identity or security. TDID bridges the gap between absolute identity control and practical delegation needs in an increasingly digital world.

## Core Components

### 1. Identity Provider Verification Contract
- Validates and authenticates legitimate credential issuers
- Implements trust frameworks for different identity verification levels
- Manages cryptographic signatures for issuer attestations
- Prevents fraudulent identity providers through multi-factor validation
- Facilitates cross-jurisdictional recognition of accepted issuers
- Supports both centralized and decentralized identity providers

### 2. Delegation Authorization Contract
- Records explicit permission grants from identity owners
- Creates cryptographic proof of consent with non-repudiation
- Implements multi-signature requirements for high-value delegations
- Manages hierarchical delegation chains with inheritance controls
- Tokenizes delegation rights with non-fungible credentials
- Supports conditional logic for context-aware permissions

### 3. Scope Limitation Contract
- Defines precise boundaries of delegated authority
- Implements attribute-based access control for credential subsets
- Creates machine-readable permission taxonomies
- Manages fine-grained data minimization rules
- Enforces purpose limitation through smart contract constraints
- Supports progressive disclosure based on contextual requirements

### 4. Temporal Constraint Contract
- Manages time-limited delegation permissions
- Implements expiration and renewal mechanisms
- Creates time-bound access windows for specific contexts
- Manages timezone-aware scheduling for global applications
- Supports both absolute and relative time restrictions
- Enables automated expiry with configurable grace periods

### 5. Revocation Contract
- Handles immediate termination of delegated rights
- Implements multi-level revocation mechanisms
- Creates immutable audit trails of revocation events
- Manages credential status verification through registries
- Supports propagating revocations through delegation chains
- Enables emergency revocation through trusted recovery methods

## System Architecture

The TDID employs a modular architecture designed to ensure security, privacy, and flexibility in identity delegation:
